# Project Structure
The purpose of this repository is to act as a template and guide for the project structure which this project will adhere to.
The project subscribes to the Google C++ Style Guide, available at: https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html and the repository additionally provides a guiding hand in following this coding standard.

## Descriptions
- src: contains all source files and their respective (private) header files (these are meant for internal use and are not meant for distribution to the public).
- include: contains all "public interface" headers, all the headers that are for public (external) consumption. (Will probably not be used).
- lib: contains all library files. (Will probably not be used).
- tests: contains all test files (unit tests, integration tests, etc).
- CMakeLists.txt: Used to generate a Makefile (build system-independent).
- Makefile: Used to compile all the code and get executable code (provided by the CMake file).
- build: all files generated by compilation should be here.
- docs: folder for documentation files.
- README.md: (the file you are currently viewing) should provide general project overview, contributors, stakeholders, contact information, dependencies and requirements, instructions of how to use/install the project.
